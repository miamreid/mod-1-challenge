# Module 1 Refactoring Challenge

## Description

Taking the original source code for a marketing agency website, it was apparent that the code needed to be consolidated, optimized for accessibility, and re-structured with semantic HTML elements. 

The original source code and css had many redundancies in code which could be condensed in order to reduce the css file and lessen the file size burden. As far as accessibility, the original HTML structure used divs rather than semantic HTML elements, making it illegible for handicapped users that require special devices to view or comprehend the website. This accessibility issue alone contributes most to the refactoring project.

Refactoring the code also helped optimize the site, with a descriptive title, alt text on every image, and logical structure.

I learned about additional semantic HTML elements while refactoring the source code, such as "article", "aside", and "nav".

## Usage

Users that visit this website are able to research the Horiseon marketing agency services and benefits. The navigation bar showcases the main services that Horiseon offers, which can be read about in further detail below the hero image. When users scroll past the hero, they can see the services offered, as well as benefits of Horiseon in the right-hand column.
